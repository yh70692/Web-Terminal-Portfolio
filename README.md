# Web-Terminal-Portfolio

```
I wanted a terminal website to demonstrate my skills as a web developer and showcase
my expertise in various web technologies, design principles, and user experience.
The inclusion of commands like "creator," "projects," "social," and "email"
enables users to navigate and access specific information effortlessly.
This project serves as a virtual portfolio through this terminal interface,
I aim to provide a unique and engaging way for users to learn about my background,
view my projects, connect with me on social networks, and even get in touch via email.
```


I also plan to refine and expand this project continually, adding more features and improvements to create an even more immersive web development experience:
- Ability to download my resume
- Add Banner Text
- More styling
- Enable view projects directly from the terminal
- And more I didn't think of yet  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
